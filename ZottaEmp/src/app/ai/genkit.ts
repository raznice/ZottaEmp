// Genkit is no longer initialized with Google AI, or Genkit itself has been removed.
// This file can be left as is if Genkit core is still used for other non-Google AI purposes,
// or it can be further simplified/emptied if Genkit is entirely removed.

// To ensure no errors if genkit package was removed:
// We'll just export a placeholder or leave it empty if all genkit references are gone.

// console.log("Genkit core initialization (without Google AI).");

// If you fully removed 'genkit' from package.json, this file trying to import 'genkit'
// would cause an error. If 'genkit' is still there but not '@genkit-ai/googleai',
// then a minimal genkit init would be:
// import {genkit} from 'genkit';
// export const ai = genkit();

// For now, to ensure no issues if genkit is removed, we'll make it very minimal.
// If you completely removed genkit from package.json, you might want to delete this file
// or ensure no other part of your app tries to import 'ai' from here.

export const ai = {}; // Placeholder if Genkit is removed or not used.
